Once your Go2 is setup to run in full autonomy, you can get started with exploring different modes offered via OM1 and explore the functionalities.
There are two ways to do this:
1. Voice commands
2. Via Portal

## Voice commands

Step 1: Configure your API key in ~/.bashrc file and start your machine in full autonomy mode.
Step 2: Start talking to your robot dog and ask it to switch to a particular mode.
    For example,
    The robot says, hi I'm your friendly robot dog, how may I help you?
    The user can then request the robot to switch to a particular mode by saying, switch to [desired mode].

- Desired mode: **Welcome**
    trigger_keywords: ["reset", "start over", "welcome mode", "restart", "initialize"]
- Desired mode: **Conversation**
    trigger_keywords: ["talk", "chat", "conversation", "tell me", "ask you", "discuss"]
- Desired mode: **Slam**
    trigger_keywords: ["explore", "map", "navigate", "look around", "slam", "wander"]
- Desired mode: **Navigation**
    trigger_keywords: ["navigate", "navigation", "go to", "take me to", "show me"]
- Desired mode: **Guard**
    trigger_keywords: ["guard", "security", "patrol", "keep watch"]


## Portal

Step 1: Configure your API key in ~/.bashrc file and start your machine in full autonomy mode.
Step 2: Login to your OM1 portal and head over to Machine Teleops on the left navigation bar.

Step 3: Once connected, you’ll see your machine listed as **Online** at the top of the screen.

Step 4: Scroll down to access the Mode Selection section. From here, choose the mode you want your robot to switch to.

Step 5: In SLAM Mode, you can manually guide the robot through its environment to generate a map. As you move, you can label specific areas and have the robot remember them. The resulting map should appear as follows:

Step 6: Once the map is saved, switch to Navigation Mode to make the robot move autonomously between locations.
    Use the dropdown menu to select a destination.

Step 7: You can also monitor three live camera streams directly from the portal.

These steps and exploration methods provide a structured approach to understanding and managing OM1’s modes.
